# task_management_app
A simple and interactive command-line Task Manager built using Python.
This program allows you to add, update, delete, and view tasks in a user-friendly loop.

🚀 Features
•	📝 Add Tasks
•	✏️ Update Existing Tasks
•	🗑️ Delete Tasks
•	👀 View All Tasks
•	🚪 Exit the app anytime

📌 How It Works
•	Tasks are stored in a Python list
•	The user enters the number of initial tasks
•	A loop keeps running until the user selects Exit (5)
•	Each operation (Add, Update, Delete, View) is handled via menu input

🧠 Program Logic
List Structure:
tasks = ["Task1", "Task2", "Task3"]
•	Each task is stored as a simple string
•	Operations modify the list dynamically
